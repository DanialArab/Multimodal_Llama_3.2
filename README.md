# Multimodal_Llama_3.2

Llama stack is a series of APIs for customizing Llama models and building Llama based agentic application.

An agentic application refers to software or a system that behaves like an autonomous "agent." It operates with a degree of independence and decision-making, capable of performing tasks, solving problems, or carrying out processes without requiring constant human input. These applications often involve artificial intelligence or machine learning models that allow the system to make decisions based on data and predefined rules.

In the context of Llama Stack, an agentic application built with Llama models would likely be one that leverages language models like Llama (a family of AI models) to perform tasks autonomously. Examples could include intelligent assistants, chatbots, automated customer service systems, or other applications where the model can understand and respond to complex prompts, make decisions, and even adapt its behavior based on interaction.
